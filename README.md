## 📋 Overview

## Maintainer reference: native SDK baseline

The branch [`hedge/native-sdk-baseline`](https://github.com/BrennanOwYong/BubbleLab/tree/hedge/native-sdk-baseline)
is the native BubbleLab SDK baseline for future integration work. Its parent commit, `b110d4d`,
is the point immediately after the repository and SDK structure were documented and before the
later integration refactors. The branch tip records this baseline as commit `263068d`.

Start here before building a documentation-digestion or add-a-tool pipeline:

1. Read [`docs/plan/REPO-MAP.md`](./docs/plan/REPO-MAP.md) for the file-level architecture map.
2. Read [`docs/reference/BUBBLELAB_SDK_DISTILLED.md`](./docs/reference/BUBBLELAB_SDK_DISTILLED.md)
   for the contracts that generated flows and bubbles must preserve.
3. Read [`composio-eval/README.md`](./composio-eval/README.md) for the Composio research index.
4. Read [`composio-eval/COMPOSIO-VS-BUBBLELAB-ADVISORY.md`](./composio-eval/COMPOSIO-VS-BUBBLELAB-ADVISORY.md)
   and [`composio-eval/IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md`](./composio-eval/IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md) before
   designing a Composio-backed integration.

The required alignment points are the `BubbleFactory` registry, named `ServiceBubble` classes,
Zod parameter and result schemas, credential injection, parser recognition, metadata catalogue,
and the documented build order. A new integration pipeline must preserve these contracts even
when it uses the latest vendor documentation or Composio tool metadata as its source.

[**Bubble Lab**](https://www.bubblelab.ai/) is a Slack-native AI operator platform that helps teams automate operational work directly inside Slack using Pearl, its AI assistant.

Instead of switching between tools, teams can ask Pearl to execute workflows, access systems, and perform tasks across their stack.

This repository contains the **open-core workflow engine that powers the Bubble Lab platform**.

It is the same execution engine used internally by Bubble Lab — and can also be run, hosted, and extended independently.

This makes it suitable for:

- Teams using the Bubble Lab platform  
- Developers who want full control over workflow execution  
- Organizations that need self-hosted automation infrastructure  
- Engineers building custom agents or integrations  

---

## 🧠 How this relates to Bubble Lab Platform

You can use Bubble Lab in two ways:

### Option 1 — Use Bubble Lab Platform (recommended)

Use the fully managed platform with:

- Pearl, the Slack-native AI operator interface  
- Managed integrations with Slack, SaaS tools, APIs, and databases  
- Hosted workflow execution and orchestration  
- Observability dashboards and execution history  
- Team collaboration and deployment management  

👉 https://app.bubblelab.ai

---

### Option 2 — Run the Open-Core Engine Yourself

You can run and host the workflow engine independently.

This allows you to:

- Build and execute workflows locally  
- Host the engine in your own infrastructure  
- Create custom agents and integrations  
- Extend the runtime for your own use cases  
- Export workflows and deploy anywhere  
- Embed Bubble Lab workflows inside your own products  

Everything in this repository is fully functional and production-ready.

---

## ⚙️ What this repository provides

The open-core engine includes:

- Workflow execution runtime  
- Agent and integration primitives ("Bubbles")  
- Local workflow studio  
- Execution tracing, logging, and observability  
- CLI tooling  
- Exportable workflows  

This is the infrastructure layer that powers Bubble Lab and Pearl.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A — Use Bubble Lab Platform

No setup required:

https://app.bubblelab.ai

---

### Option B — Run locally


Run Bubble Studio locally in **2 commands**:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Start everything
pnpm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** and you can now build, edit, and run workflows locally!

**⚠️ Note:** To create flow with pearl (our ai assistant), you'll need API keys (GOOGLE_API_KEY). By default gemini-3.0-pro is used for generation and code edits use fast find-and-replace. Weaker model is not well tested and can lead to degraded/inconsistent performance. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Option C — Create a new Bubble Lab project

Get started with BubbleLab in seconds using our CLI tool:

```bash
npx create-bubblelab-app
```

This will scaffold a new BubbleLab project with:

- Pre-configured TypeScript setup with core packages and run time installed
- Sample templates (basic, reddit-scraper, etc.) you can choose
- All necessary dependencies
- Ready-to-run example workflows you fully control, customize

**Next steps after creation:**

```bash
cd my-agent
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### What You'll Get: Real-World Example

Let's look at what BubbleFlow code actually looks like using the **reddit-scraper** template:

**The Flow** (`reddit-news-flow.ts`) - Just **~50 lines** of clean TypeScript:

```typescript
export class RedditNewsFlow extends BubbleFlow<'webhook/http'> {
  async handle(payload: RedditNewsPayload) {
    const subreddit = payload.subreddit || 'worldnews';
    const limit = payload.limit || 10;

    // Step 1: Scrape Reddit for posts
    const scrapeResult = await new RedditScrapeTool({
      subreddit: subreddit,
      sort: 'hot',
      limit: limit,
    }).action();

    const posts = scrapeResult.data.posts;

    // Step 2: AI analyzes and summarizes the posts
    const summaryResult = await new AIAgentBubble({
      message: `Analyze these top ${posts.length} posts from r/${subreddit}:
        ${postsText}

        Provide: 1) Summary of top news, 2) Key themes, 3) Executive summary`,
      model: { model: 'google/gemini-2.5-flash' },
    }).action();

    return {
      subreddit,
      postsScraped: posts.length,
      summary: summaryResult.data?.response,
      status: 'success',
    };
  }
}
```

**What happens when you run it:**

```bash
$ npm run dev

✅ Reddit scraper executed successfully
{
  "subreddit": "worldnews",
  "postsScraped": 10,
  "summary": "### Top 5 News Items:\n1. China Halts US Soybean Imports...\n2. Zelensky Firm on Ukraine's EU Membership...\n3. Hamas Demands Release of Oct 7 Attackers...\n[full AI-generated summary]",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-07T21:35:19.882Z",
  "status": "success"
}

Execution Summary:
  Total Duration: 13.8s
  Bubbles Executed: 3 (RedditScrapeTool → AIAgentBubble → Return)
  Token Usage: 1,524 tokens (835 input, 689 output)
  Memory Peak: 139.8 MB
```

**What's happening under the hood:**

1. **RedditScrapeTool** scrapes 10 hot posts from r/worldnews
2. **AIAgentBubble** (using Google Gemini) analyzes the posts
3. Returns structured JSON with summary, themes, and metadata
4. Detailed execution stats show performance and token usage

**Key Features:**

- **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
- **Simple** - Just chain "Bubbles" (tools/nodes) together with `.action()`
- **Observable** - Built-in logging shows exactly what's executing
- **Production-ready** - Error handling, metrics, and performance tracking included
